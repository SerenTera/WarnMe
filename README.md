# warnme
A Tera Proxy module that warns you when specific objects(mobs like mongos/blue boxes) are in your vicinity

This does not warn you about objects that are outside your radar range. This only warns you when the object is loaded onto your visible vicinity (ie. on your radar). 

Warning is done via client sided system messages as default, but system notices (displays a message in the middle of your screen) can be turned on. Module and system notices are disabled by default. 

Commands:

!warn on - switches on module

!warn off -switches off module

!warn alert - Toggles system notices


Currently only supports Big Blue Boxes. Can be modified for other objects
